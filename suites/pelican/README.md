Pelican Test Plan

Pelican service provides support to PFB (Portable Format for Biomedical data). This format is for data serialization of clinical data, metadata and ontology and it is based on Avro serialization format.

PFB allows us to efficiently store and send files to Postgres. It will also supports versioning which allows to resubmit all in a commons if there is a dictionary changes.
