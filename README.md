# Gen3 Automated Integration Test
This is the repository for managing integration tests used for Gen3 data commons. 

Frameworks/Tools:
- CodeceptJS: primary testing framework ([docs](https://codecept.io/))
- Chai: additional assertion writing ([docs](http://www.chaijs.com/api/))
- Jenkins: CI, automated builds and tests 

# Setup
## General Info
The testsuite is run either in Jenkins, when testing a build, or on a local machine, when developing tests. The setup is slightly different for each and is explained below.
### Environent Variables
Tests require access tokens, usernames, passwords, etc., which we store in environment variables.

The environment variable `NAMESPACE` must be defined in your shell running the tests. This variable defines the data commons to run the test on. Note that this variable must be a variable in your shell, not in your auto-qa-config file (explained below).

The process of fetching most of the commons variables is automated by the script set for `bootstrap` in the CodeceptJS configuration file.
If there are things which cannot/should not be fetched in the commons by the setup script, you can setup a JSON config file named `auto-qa-config.json` in a `.gen3` folder in your home directory, `~/.gen3/auto-qa-config.json`. For example:
```
# homeDirectory/.gen3/auto-qa-config.json
{
  SPECIAL_SECRET: '*******',
  MY_VAR: {
    myString: 'abcd123'
    myNum: 12
  }
}
```
In setup, these values will be read and exported to environment variables before running the test. So in the example above `MY_VAR` is actually going to be a string that will need to be parsed when it's used. Note that the setup gives environment variables higher priority over the config file. So if you did `export MY_VAL="rock"` in the shell you're running the test and in your config had `{ MY_VAL: "scissors" }`, when the test is run, `process.env.MY_VAL === "rock"`.

## Local
After cloning this repo, get the required packages by running `npm install`.
### Selenium
To automate web browser actions, CodeceptJS requires a Selenium webserver. You have two options here: Docker or npm. Note that for both methods, you can visit `localhost:4444/wd/hub/sessions` to see current Selenium session/check that the server is running.
#### Docker ([link](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium))
If you have docker, you can just run the preconfigured container
```
docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-chrome
```
To kill the server just kill the container.
#### npm ([link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone))
If you'd rather not fool with docker, you can run the server yourself with an npm package. 
If you already ran `npm install`, the package selenium-standalone should have been installed. You'll also need to install the webdriver, just run `npm run selenium-install`.

You'll need the Java SDK, version 8, to use Selenium so make sure you have that installed as well (check output of `javac -version`, e.g. javac 1.8.0_171 means I have version 8.0_171)

Once this is done, you can run `npm run selenium-start`, and the server will start running on port 4444 by default.

You can kill the server with `npm run selenium-kill`

### Data _(optional)_
Some tests need data to submit, so this step is required only if you plan on running/writing tests that submit, delete, or query graph data (aka nodes). If your test doesn't need this stuff, just skip this step.
Currently you have to clone the [occ/data-simulator](https://github.com/occ-data/data-simulator) repo, install R, install the required packages, and manually run the command for generating simulated data.

The tests assume that data is simulated for project `test`, and that only 1 sample is simulated for each node type. Here's an example command of what that would look like if we were saving the data to `~/testData/`:
```
Rscript GenTestDataCmd.R https://my.dictionary.url/ test 1 ~/testData/
```


# Test Development
## Running Tests
Once you have your environment variables configured and the Selenium server is running, you should be able to successfully run the tests. To execute all tests, run `npm test`. But as mentioned above, some tests have special requirements so you may not want to run them. Instead, you can run a selection of tests that have certain tag by running `npm test -- --grep "@MyTag"` (see info about tags in the Writing Tests section). You can also run a specific suite by adding the path to the test you want to run: `npm test ./suites/apis/myApiTest.js`.

## Writing Tests
Each API or web page feature is contained in a singe .js file. They are stored in `suites/apis` and `suites/portal`, with filenames matching the pattern `*Test.js`.

Refer to the [CodeceptJS docs](https://codecept.io/basics/) existing tests for info and writing patterns. TLDR for the basics:
- A `*Test.js` file tests a single `Feature`
- A `Feature` is a collection of `Scenario`s
- A `Scenario` is a single use case/flow of a feature (e.g. a flow with good input, a flow with bad input) 

Here's what it looks like in code:
```js
// in myFeatureTest.js
Feature('MyFeature');

Scenario('use feature good input', () => {
  // do something with good input and expect success!
});

Scenario('use feature bad input', () => {
  // do something with bad input and expect some error!
});
```

`Scenario`s are where we actually do things and ask questions about the results. So what does the 'doing' and the 'asking'? That's the job of a `service`!

### Services
A `service` directly translates to a single gen3 API or web page (e.g. sheepdog API or dictionary web page). They allow you to perform actions and ask about the state of it's subject. Rather than making direct API calls or clicking around on a page within a test, we create a `service` to abstract away the details (e.g. specific endpoints, css locators for HTML elements, etc) for doing a task or making an assertion about state.

`service`s are located in the directories `service/api` and `service/portal`. To include a service in a `Scenario`, see [Using services in Scenarios](#using-services-in-scenarios) below.

#### Attributes
Services have the following attributes

| attribute | description | verb/accessor | example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| props | collection of properties about the service/page (e.g. endpoints, or page element locators) | props | homepage.props.chart |
| tasks | performs a single action of the service/page | do | sheepdog.do.addNode(aliquotNode) |
| questions | makes assertions about the service/page | ask | homepage.ask.seeProp(homepage.props.chart)
| sequences | sequence of multiple tasks and questions | complete | sheepdog.complete.addNodes(allNodesList) |

##### task
A task is usually composed of calls to CodeceptJS's `actor()`, which is referenced as `I`. CodeceptJS's actor gives us easy access to things like navigating webpages and making REST API calls (e.g. `I.click('.my-button')` and `I.sendGetRequest('/user/user')`). Get familiar with the CodeceptJS helpers and their functions:
- [WebdriverIO](https://codecept.io/helpers/WebDriverIO/) (web page stuff)
- [REST](https://codecept.io/helpers/REST/) (API stuff)

##### question
A question is a method that makes an assertion. For web pages, they are usually written using CodeceptJS's `actor()` (e.g. `I.seeNumberOfElements('.header1', 2)`). For everything that we can't use CodeceptJS's actor for (API assertions) we use Chai. Checkout the Chai expect [documentation here](http://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/).

##### props
A `service`'s props is just a collection of values that are used when performing tasks and asking questions. This would include:
- API endpoints
- Expected API results
- Web page URL
- Locators for HTML elements 

##### sequence
A sequence is just a collection of tasks and questions. For example, if you had a series of tasks and questions you were repeating in your tests (e.g. submitting something then validating it was submitted successfully) you can just create a sequence to wrap this up into one call.

It's recommended that you only make assertions about state in questions, keep 'em out of any tasks. If you're tempted to write an assertion in a task, think about whether you are really doing a fundamental action of the service/page. Just write it into a sequence if you really need to do both a task and question.

#### Using `service`s in `Scenario`s
To use a service in a `Scenario`, insert it in the `Scenario` callback:
```js
// in file myTest.js
Feature('MyFeatureA')

// See codeceptjs docs for info on Before/BeforeSuite/After/AfterSuite
BeforeSuite((myService) => {
  myService.complete.someSetup();
});

Scenario('use feature with good input', (myService) => {
  const result = myService.do.someTask(goodInput);
  myService.ask.resultSuccess(result);
});

Scenario('use feature with bad input', (myService) => {
  const result = myService.do.someTask(badInput);
  myService.ask.resultHasError(result, 'invalid input!');
});
```

#### Creating a new `service`
To create a new service, use the command `npm create-service`.
A couple of files will be generated with the given service name in either `services/apis` or `services/portal` depending on the service type you select.
After running the command, you must add the service to the codecept.conf.js file for it to be accessible by `Scenario`s:
```js
// in codecept.conf.js
...
  include: {
    myService: "./services/apis/myService.js"
  }
...
```

#### Async tasks/questions
Most tasks are asynchronous, so asking questions about their state require a little async/await work. For most funcitons, you can return another funciton's promise and `await` for the promise to resolve in the Scenario. For example
```js
// myServiceTasks.js
module.exports = {
  async getSomething() {
    return I.sendGetRequest('/endpoint')
  }
}

// myServiceQuestions.js
module.exports = {
  hasNoErrors(response) {
    expect(response).to.not.have.property('error')
  }
}

// myTest.js
Scenario('my test', (actor) => {
  // we have to await here before continuing!
  const response = await actor.do.getSomething();
  actor.ask.hasNoErrors(response);
});
```

When creating new Promises, avoid using reject unless you are going to catch it yourself. If we end up calling the reject() it will throw an error into the "global promise chain" of CodeceptJS, and importantly the test will fail without any meaningful stacktrace about what went wrong. Instead, you could do resolve({ error: err_obj }), and in a question assert there is no error.

### Tags
Adding a tag (`@tag`) to a Scenario name allows filtering which tests are run. If your test is special for some reason (e.g. only applies to one commons) add a tag like so:
```
Scenario('test something @reqGoogle', () => {...});
```
Then using CodeceptJS's `--grep` flag we can filter the tags for example, to run only tests that have been flagged with `@DCFOnly`, we could do `npm test -- --grep '@DCFOnly'`. We can also invert the flags with `--grep '@DCFOnly' --invert` (see [CodeceptJS's command docs](https://codecept.io/commands/)).
